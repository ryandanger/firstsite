<p style="color:white;"> 
hello and welcome to the guide. 
<br>
There's only a few steps to get the best library of Movies and TV Shows right on your computer!
<br>
<br>
1. Head to <a href="https://plex.tv/users/sign_up">https://plex.tv/users/sign_up</a href> and make an account (Please make sure you check your emails and verify your account too!)
<br>
<br>
2. Once you've verified your email, send me your username so I can share my libraries with you!
<br>
<br>
3. Once I've added you to the server, you should get an email telling you to accept my invitation, so just go ahead and accept.
<br>
<br>
4. Hopefully your email took you to Plex's website, so now you'll want to hit the little home in the top left and then you're all done! You've got some cool stuff to watch.
<br>
(but if for some reason you're not on the Plex site, heading to <a href="https://app.plex.tv/web/app#!/settings/users/friends">https://app.plex.tv/web/app#!/settings/users/friends</a href> should allow you to accept the invite)
<br>
<br>

enjoy
